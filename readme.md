This is a simple Calendar Management System written in Python-Flask combined with a SQL database.  
To run the application, clone the repository onto your local machine and run app.py. 
To get reminders, enter a valid Gmail ID and password in forms.py and login to the Gmail account on the same machine(you'll need to enable application access on your gmail). You'll receive reminders as long as you're logged in on the calendar application.
Contact the contributors if you actually decide to run this application and need more help.
